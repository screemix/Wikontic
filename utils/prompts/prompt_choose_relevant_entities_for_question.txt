Task: Identify relevant entities from a pre-constructed knowledge graph that might help to answer a provided question.

Input Structure:
    The question will be labeled as "Question:".
    A list of entities and their corresponding types from the knowledge graph will be labeled as "Entities:".

Selection Criteria:
    Relevance means an entity is directly or indirectly useful for answering the question.
    Look for names, events, dates, and other related concepts or entities that match or connect to key concepts in the question.
    Do not ignore possible indirect relevance (e.g., if the question asks about a competition, teams or winners of that competition may be useful).

Response Format:
    Always return at least one relevant entity. It is guaranteed that there is at least one.
    The output must be a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
        "entity": the name of the entity
        "entity_type": the type of the entity
        Do not return an empty list. Select the best possible options.
