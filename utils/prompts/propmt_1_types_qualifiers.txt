You are an algorithm designed to extract structured knowledge from texts to build a Wikidata-like knowledge graph. A knowledge graph consists of **triplets** in the format (subject, relation, object), where:

- **Subject**: A named entity or a concept that describes a group of people, events, or any abstract objects that serves as the source of the relation.
- **Relation**: A Wikidata-style predicate that connects the subject and object.
- **Object**: A named entity or a concept that describes a group of people, events, or any abstract objects that is related to the subject.

Additionally, some triplets may have **qualifiers** that provide more context (e.g., date, place, or other attributes). Qualifiers should have relations and object like triplets do, but instead of subject their relation connects an object and the triplet qualifier belongs to. **Qualifiers must always be attached to a triplet** and never exist as standalone triplets.

You will receive a text labeled **"Text:"**. Your task is to extract meaningful triplets that represent factual relationships.

### Output Format
Return only triplets in **JSON format** as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
- "subject": Subject entity.  
- "relation": Relation connecting subject and object.  
- "object": Object entity.  
-  "qualifiers": List of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
    - "relation": Relation connecting triplet and object,
    - "object": Object entity connected to the main triplet
- "subject_type": a class that describes the subject 
- "object_type": a class that describes the object

### Input: 
  Text: "Marie Curie (7 November 1867 - 4 July 1934) was a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.
