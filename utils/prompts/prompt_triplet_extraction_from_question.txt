Your task is to parse a question to identify and structure factual elements in a triplet format. 
This structured output should help identify potential matches in a knowledge graph by making each query term explicit and easy to match with graph data.

You will be provided with the textual question entitled "Question:". 
Your task is to extract the triplets with both known and unknown entities and relation. 
For subject, relation or object of the triplet that are unknown, you are expected to use <entity> or <relation> placeholders in the triplet to denote the unknown entry.
You are expected to output only the list of identified triplets in a JSON format. 
Each triplet should have fields "subject", "relation", and "object" for subject, relation, and object or their placeholders correspondingly. 
Here are a few examples of input questions and expected output for each of them:

<example>
Input:
    Question: The Dutch-Belgian television series that "House of Anubis" was based on first aired in what year?
Output:
    [
		{
			"subject": "<entity>",
			"relation": "instance of", 
			"object": "television series"
		},
        {
            "subject": "<entity>",
			"relation": "origin", 
			"object": "Dutch-Belgian"
        },
		{
			"subject": "House of Anubis",
			"relation": "based on", 
			"object": "<entity>"
		},
        {
			"subject": "<entity>",
			"relation": "aired on", 
			"object": "<entity>"
		},

    ]
</example>

<example>
Input:
    Question: 'What is the length of the track where the 2013 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour was staged?'
Output:
        [
        {   
			"subject": "2013 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour",
			"relation": "staged on", 
			"object": "<entity>"
		},
        {   
			"subject": "<entity>",
			"relation": "has length", 
			"object": "<entity>"
		},

    ]
