In the previous step, there were extracted triplets from the Wikidata knowledge graph. Each triplet contains two entities (subject and object) and one relation that connects these subject and object. However, some of the entities and relations extracted in the previous step may have not an exact name from Wikidata. 
We linked each subject, relation, and object name with top similar exact names from the Wikidata by semantic similarity. Your task is to choose appropriate names for entities and relations that correspond to the text"s context and triplet they were taken from.

The input format is following: 
    Text: <Text from the previous step for triplets extraction>

    Triplets and corresponding entity and relation mappings:

        <triplet_1>
        {<extracted_subject_1>: <list of 5 exact names similar to subject_1>}
        {<extracted_relation_1>: <list of 5 exact names similar to relation_1>}
        {<extracted_object_1>: <list of 5 exact names similar to object_1>}

        ...

        <triplet_n>
        {<extracted_subject_n>: <list of 5 exact names similar to subject_n>}
        {<extracted_relation_n>: <list of 5 exact names similar to relation_n>}
        {<extracted_object_n>: <list of 5 exact names similar to object_n>}


For each triplet obtained in the previous step, you will be provided with the corresponding 5 exact names of similar subjects, relations, and objects from the Wikidata knowledge graph.
For each subject, relation, and object from the extracted triplets, you should choose the most appropriate name only from the corresponding list of 5 exact ones that better match each triplet and the context of the previously demonstrated text.
For each relation and entity in the triplets use chosen names only from the provided list of exact similar names. You can keep the original name unchanged only in case it is already in the list and fits the context of the text and extracted triplet better than other options.
In the output provide only the list of updated triplets in JSON format. Each triplet should have fields "subject", "relation", and "object" for updated subject, relation, and object correspondingly. 

Here are some examples of previously extracted triplets with imprecise names, a list of linked exact names, and corresponding corrected outputs:
