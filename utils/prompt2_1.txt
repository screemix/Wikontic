You will be provided with the text and triplets from Wikidata knowledge graph that LLM extracted from this text. Each triplet contains two entities (subject and object) and one relation that connects these subject and object. Entities represent nodes in the knowledge graph, while relation represents a link between these two nodes. 
Subjects and objects could be named entities or concepts describing a group of people, events, or abstract objects from the Wikidata knowledge graph. 
Moreover, for each triplet, you will be provided with the corresponding 5 exact names of similar subject, relation and object from the Wikidata knowledge graph.
The input format is following: ```
			        Text:
			        <Text from the previous step for triplets extraction>	   
                    

                    Triplets:

                    <triplet_1>
                    <extracted_subject_1: [extracted_subject_1_1, ..., extracted_subject_1_5] 
                    <extracted_relation_1: [exact_relation_1_1, ..., exact_relation_1_5]
                    <extracted_object_1: [extracted_object_1_1, ..., extracted_object_1_5] 
                    
                    ...

                    <triplet_n>
                    <extracted_subject_n: [extracted_subject_n_1, ..., extracted_subject_n_5] 
                    <extracted_relation_n: [exact_relation_n_1, ..., exact_relation_n_5] \n\n>
                    <extracted_object_n: [extracted_object_n_1, ..., extracted_object_n_5]
                    ```
For each subject, relation and object from the extracted triplets, you should choose one most probable name only from the corresponding list of 5 probable ones that better match each triplet and the context of the previously demonstrated text.
In the output provide only the list of updated triplets in JSON format, but instead of previously extracted names of relations and entities use the chosen ones from the provided list of similar names.
