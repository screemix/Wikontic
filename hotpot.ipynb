He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N\\' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.

During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler\\'s Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler.  In early 2017, Steven Adler declared that he has no intention to continue with the band, and that the band has now dissolved, and the reason is his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.  He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\", as well as on the first season of its spin-off \"Sober House\".  He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N\\' Roses.',\n",
